$ make
$ make test
$ lua probe.lua

For testing purposes set the loader path thusly:

  $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


To Do
-----

* Figure out how to get a reference to the loaded library in the global
  namespace.  The functions are accessible in "_G.package.loaded.dicebag".

* Learn how to call dicebag_init() when the library is loaded, instead of
  having an explicit call.
